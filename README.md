# Brainwave-analysis-project
MATLAB project to analyze EEG signals and classify mental state
# EEG Signal Processing and Mental State Classification

This MATLAB project simulates and analyzes EEG signals to classify mental states (Stressed or Relaxed). It includes:
- Image-based EEG extraction
- Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) analysis
- Normalized low-pass Butterworth filtering
- Alpha wave (8-13 Hz) extraction
- Feature extraction (Mean, RMS, Skewness, Kurtosis, Energy)
- Mental state classification based on Alpha band power

## Technologies Used
- MATLAB
- Signal Processing Toolbox
- Image Processing Toolbox

## How to Run
1. Upload an EEG image (or use simulated signal).
2. The code performs DFT, filtering, alpha wave extraction, feature calculation, and classifies the mental state.
3. Output is displayed on the console and plots are generated for analysis.

## Project Status
✅ Functional  
✅ Tested on MATLAB R2021b and above
